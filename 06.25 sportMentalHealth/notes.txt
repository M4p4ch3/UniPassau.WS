"Pressures of training for and racing a triathlon
Can build up and become overwhelming,
But on the flip size, swimming, cycling, and running
Actually act as an escape from the pressure of everyday life"

"Mental health issues are as real as a broken leg"

And then accepting it is often the hardest part"
